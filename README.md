# ODSCWest2016
Material for Introduction to Data Science with Python Workshop, ODSC West, 2016.

# Abstract

Do you know Python basics and want develop your chops in the Data Science realm? If so, this is the Workshop for you. Herein, you’ll gain hands-on experience with 4 four major components of the Data Scientist’s toolbox: data visualization, statistics, data manipulation and machine learning. We’ll spend about an hour on each of these, using real world data sets. You’ll dive deep into the pandas, scikit-learn and bokeh libraries, among others. Come along and join DataCamp’s Python Curriculum engineer, Hugo Bowne-Anderson, for a detailed tour of the major Data Science functionalities in PythonLand.

# Installing Python for the Workshop

For this Workshop you will need the most recent stable releases of the following:

- Python 3.5
- matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- bokeh
- IPython
- Jupyter Notebook

I highly recommend installing the [Anaconda distribution here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (available for Linux, Mac, Windows).

To get the newest releases of scikit-learn, seaborn and bokeh (necessary for Workshop), you will need to run the following in your terminal:

$ conda install seaborn
$ conda update scikit-learn
$ conda update bokeh

Also confirm that when you type

$ jupyter notebook

in your terminal, that you see the notebook panel load in your web browser.

# Getting the Workshop Material

All Workshop materials will be avaiable in this repository at 2100PT 11/03, that is, 12 hours before the Workshop begins! Check back in then. Do your best to download them before the Workshop as the wifi is generally unreliable at large conferences!
